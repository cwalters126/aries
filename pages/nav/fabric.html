                    <h4>Parts of a Quilt</h4>

                    <p><h6>Top quilt:</h6> The meat of your project (you'll spend hours cutting, ironing, sewing, and piecing this part)</p>

                    <p> <h6>Batting:</h6> The insulating middle part. There's lots of options; cotton, wool, bamboo, or a cotton/poly blend. (I've used cotton and cotton/poly blend) Craft stores typically sell it off the bolt, or in traditional bedding sizes (queen, full, etc). If you go through the longarmer I mentioned below, you can buy the batting through her and she takes care of all that for you.</p>

                    <p><h6>Quilt backing:</h6> Whatever you want on the back. I typically buy "extra wide quilt backing", which is 108 ish inches wide instead of the normal 40 - 60 inches. That way I don't have a seam in the backside fabric. I have heard of people using "minky" as a quilt backing, but I am a bit too traditional for that :) </p>

                    <br />
                    <h5>Long Armer</h5>
                    <p>You can complete a quilt without long arming, but my favorites are all long armed! (we can discuss how this works when it comes up, but this is who I like to use. She lives in Roselle, and takes about 6 weeks. I recommend checking out her "penny pantogram" promotion, and I add on the "exact cut" for $10. Totally worth it. She will also do your binding if you want. I'm sure she does incredible work but I have always done mine myself)</p>

                    <h5>Fabrics</h5>
                    <p>It's an overwhelming topic! Here are some words you might see when you go to buy quilting fabrics:</p>
                    <p>Charm Packs (precut 5 inch squares)</p>
                    <p>Layer Cakes (10 inch squares)</p>
                    <p>Jelly Rolls (2.5 inch strips)</p>
                    <p>Mini Charms (2.5 in squares)</p>
                    <p>Fat Quarters (see below)</p>

                    <p>I don't buy these Precut options much because I like to spend 2 hours in the fabric store matching patterns and colors. If that sounds stressful, Charm packs might be a good option for you!</p>

                    <h5>Fat Quarters</h5>
                    <p>
                        Cut differently than how you would normally ask for 1/4 yard off the bolt at the cutting counter. A lot of Quilters prefer them. Some patterns will specify this cut is required. I don't really have a preference. But that's what it means.
                        I use cotton exclusively when quilting. I haven't ventured out of cotton much with clothing either!
                    </p>

                    <h5>Tags</h5>
                    <p>It is important to have a tag on your work, especially if you are giving them away! I customized some from this <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1551375874/20x60mm-name-labels-clothing-labels-name?ref=yr_purchases">Etsy Shop</a>. (I know there are so many other things you have to buy when you are just starting out, so don't worry too much about this one yet!)</p>
